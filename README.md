# MY PORTFOLIO

As of today, I can share with you the google drive where I keep the project I delivered (as part of a group of 2 people) for the QA testing bootcamp.
Here is the [link to the whole project](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1unvXHl3XYSf_pfE_w5gRFoYm2XlHgzXs), it's in Spanish but I have plans of translating it in the future.
